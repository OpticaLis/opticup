### 2026-05-08 — phone-434-legacy-cleanup-closure (M3_PHONE_434_LEGACY_CLEANUP)

- **Context:** SPEC `M3_PHONE_434_LEGACY_CLEANUP` authored 2026-05-08 to close REC-SITE-002 file-level half by deleting 3 storefront files containing the defunct `053-434-7265`. Step 0 verification revealed all 3 files were ALREADY DELETED by storefront commit `a4723b5` (2026-05-07, by Daniel) — the same commit that did the M3_PHONE_TEMPLATING_AND_CLEANUP CMS-row work. SPEC was authored on stale state. Live homepage already 0 occurrences of `053-434-7265`.
- **Question:** Three closure paths surfaced via AskUserQuestion: (a) ERP retro only — skip storefront commit, (b) empty marker commit on storefront for criterion-6 literal compliance, (c) abort SPEC entirely.
- **Decision:** "ERP retro only — skip storefront commit." (Daniel via tool prompt during executor session.)
- **Rationale:** The cleanup work was genuinely already done; no storefront-side change has any content. An empty marker commit would have been pure ceremony. Aborting entirely would have lost the audit trail (Site Overseer needs to formally mark REC-SITE-002 closed). ERP retro captures the documentation closure + the Foreman pre-flight learning.
- **Operational action:** ERP commit on develop with EXECUTION_REPORT + FINDINGS + HANDOFF (REC-SITE-002 closed) + DECISIONS_LOG (this entry). 0 storefront commits. 0 PRs. Findings: M3-SPEC-01 (MEDIUM — Foreman authored SPEC on stale state) + M3-DATA-02 (INFO — `_deprecated/` retains 5 unrelated files, leave intact per §7).
- **Cross-refs:** `modules/Module 3 - Storefront/docs/specs/M3_PHONE_434_LEGACY_CLEANUP/`; storefront commit `a4723b5`; REC-SITE-002.

### 2026-05-08 — cms-blocks-restore-incident-hot-fix (M3_CMS_BLOCKS_RESTORE_AND_GUARDRAIL)

- **Context:** 16 customer-facing CMS pages on `www.prizma-optic.co.il` rendering empty bodies for ~24 hours. Root cause: M3_PHONE_TEMPLATING_AND_CLEANUP migration on 2026-05-07 did string-level `.replace()` on jsonb content and saved the result as a top-level JSON string instead of a native array. Astro renderer's `Array.isArray()` returned false → empty render. (3 of the 16 — `/accessibility/` ×3 — broken earlier on 2026-05-01 via a separate manual session that hit the same anti-pattern.)
- **Question:** Step 0 returned count = 16 broken rows, not the 15 in SPEC §1/§5/§6 stop trigger. SPEC §2's enumerated inventory actually lists 16 explicitly (1+3+3+3+3+3). Should executor STOP per literal §6 trigger or continue per intent (live state matches §2 inventory verbatim)?
- **Decision:** Continue with all 16 — Bounded-Autonomy intent-vs-literal applied. SPEC author's "15" is a §1/§5 arithmetic miscount of §2's enumerated table. Logged as Deviation 1 in EXECUTION_REPORT.
- **Rationale:** Genuine SPEC-internal contradiction; live state aligns perfectly with §2 inventory which is the most-detailed enumeration; stopping mid-flow with 16 broken pages in production was clearly worse than continuing with evidence-based count. Foreman to ratify.
- **Operational action:** Restored all 16 rows (15 single-encoded via pass2 unwrap, 1 double-encoded `/terms/` he via pass3 unwrap) plus 13 `previous_blocks` (12 pass2 + 1 pass3). Installed CHECK constraints on `storefront_pages.blocks` AND `.previous_blocks`. Verified all 16 live destinations render 40-65KB bodies. LEARNINGS L-PROJECT-002 added project-wide. Site Overseer SKILL v0.3 with case study + jsonb pre-write checklist.
- **Cross-refs:** `modules/Module 3 - Storefront/docs/specs/M3_CMS_BLOCKS_RESTORE_AND_GUARDRAIL/`; `docs/LEARNINGS.md` L-PROJECT-002; `__LAUNCH_PLAN_DRAFT__/site-overseer/SITE_OVERSEER_SKILL.md` §5b + §5c.

### 2026-05-08 — wp-blog-post-mapping (REC-SITE-015 follow-up)

- **Context:** Daniel directive 2026-05-08: "אין לי בעיה שכל עמודי המוצר הישנים יפנו את המשתמש לעמוד המותגים או משהו בסגנון. הבעיה היא עם עמודים שיש הרבה כניסות אליהם שזה בעיקר הבלוג." Bulk-fallback `/blog/` for blog posts loses high-intent SEO traffic; specific per-post mapping preserves it.
- **Question:** SPEC §2 stated Astro blog post route as `/{lang}/blog/{slug}/`, but executor's destination spot-check found that pattern returns 404; actual canonical is `/{lang}/{slug}/`. Should executor (a) STOP and re-route via Foreman, (b) fix the URL pattern in-flight and continue?
- **Decision:** Executor applied (b) under Bounded-Autonomy intent-vs-literal rule. Logged as Deviation 1 in EXECUTION_REPORT.
- **Rationale:** SPEC's intent ("send blog visitors to the matched post") is fully satisfied by the corrected URL pattern. Literal text was a Foreman fact-check failure, well-evidenced by 6/6 spot-check 404s on `/{lang}/blog/{slug}/` and 6/6 200s on `/{lang}/{slug}/`. Stopping mid-flow would have wasted ~40 min for a one-line fix. Foreman to ratify in FOREMAN_REVIEW.md.
- **Operational action:** 42 ru. post-tier redirects bulk-deleted + 42 improved imported (delta 0). en. (which had 0 redirects loaded) imported full 1,610-row CSV including REC-SITE-015 base + 43 improved blog targets. Spot-checks: 5/5 ru + 5/5 en return 301 to specific Astro posts. Both subdomains: 1,610 redirects total. SITE_OVERSEER_SKILL.md v0.2 created with knowledge map.
- **Cross-refs:** `modules/Module 3 - Storefront/docs/specs/M3_WP_BLOG_POST_MAPPING/` (SPEC, EXECUTION_REPORT, FINDINGS, CRAWL_LOG_BLOG); `__LAUNCH_PLAN_DRAFT__/site-overseer/SITE_OVERSEER_SKILL.md`; FINDINGS M3-INFRA-01.

### 2026-05-08 — wp-subdomain-redirect-scope

- **Context:** Phase A executor discovered the WordPress subdomain sitemaps expose 9 child sitemaps (post / page / product / category / post_tag / product_brand / product_cat / product_tag / author) per subdomain, totaling 3,223 URLs vs the SPEC's premised 1,675. The 4 unanticipated sitemap types (`product_brand`, `product_cat`, `product_tag`, `author`) account for +1,548 URLs of bulk-mappable taxonomy archives. SPEC §6 stop-trigger fires at >2,000 URLs.
- **Question:** Continue with all 3,223 URLs (bulk mapping under existing rules), narrow scope to original ~1,675, or split product_tag (1,350 URLs) into a separate CSV for staged review?
- **Decision:** "Include all 3,221 with bulk mapping." (Daniel via tool prompt during executor session.)
- **Rationale:** All 1,548 extra URLs funnel into 4 fixed bulk destinations (`/{lang}/categories/`, `/{lang}/products/`, `/{lang}/blog/`, `/{lang}/`) under existing rules — no per-URL decision burden, and including them prevents leaving 1,548 indexed legacy URLs uncovered for the next 30+ days.
- **Operational action:** Phase A executor mapped all 3,223 URLs into `ru.csv` (~1,611 rows) + `en.csv` (~1,611 rows). Discovery logged as a precondition gap for the SPEC author (additional sitemap types should have been enumerated upfront).
- **Cross-refs:** `modules/Module 3 - Storefront/docs/specs/M3_WP_SUBDOMAINS_REDIRECT/SPEC.md` §6 stop-trigger; `__LAUNCH_PLAN_DRAFT__/site-overseer/LEARNINGS.md` L-SITE-001.
